# Arborist in Love
### by Dimas Atha Putra

your arborist came down from upstairs
walked over to an empty space on my bed
and sat in front of me and asked
why do you people love
giving the silent treatment
and i tell her
i don’t know
i’ve never been with anybody

but it turns out
you did to her what you did to me
a few months back
after i failed to clean up my trash
in the living room
and for days
my voice muffled in your ears

i understood
that you were feeling blue
and you need the world for yourself for a while
so i muffled your voice too
and we didn’t talk

and i know she tried to understand
why the world wasn’t enough for the two of you
whenever you’re like this
she said to me how childish you were
but as you know, she loves you still

and me and her have one thing in common
we love to see you light up
to see the taste of life in you
as sweet as the dessert you bake
as savory as the dish you make
