# Poppy
### by Dimas Atha Putra

i’m in awe
bout how i can’t reconcile
not the paradox of our relationship
under the same roof

we're housemates
since we were done boarding
but then roommate came along
and it was funny

how i was in love with her
but she turn out to only
only want to talk to you
gave you a nickname
because you have a quality
she only calls out to you
and knows you better

like how i didn't know
when your birthday was
my first instinct was to ask her
because she knows a lot about you
and you know a lot about her
and all i know is you seem to never run out
of things to talk about with each other
it keeps on happening
until she stops crushing my mind

but still, that saturday night
on the way back, when you both talk on the bike
every word of hers i overheard
cuts me right in my arms
and it hurts, like that time
when she had to answer your very question
about what the truth would've been
if one of us had never went on this journey with her
devastating question
it wasn't even easy for her
because she had to choose
out of either one of us
then she pointed the gun at me,
and shot me
right in between the eyes
and after my limp body fell down on the ground
i sobbed, at how much it hurts
that's how much it hurt
and how both my dear sister and her thought
that i was sleepy
is it because i’m silent?
i was wide awake
i was the fifth wheel that saturday night
my dear sister was with Godzilla
and she was with her dear poppy
she was with you
i simply had no one to talk to

if you knew
if my roommate
would be the most affectionate to you
and would be ever-so-distant from me
would you still ask her that question?
