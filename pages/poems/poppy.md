# Poppy
### by Dimas Atha Putra

i’m in awe
bout how i can’t reconcile
not the paradox of our relationship
under the same roof

we're housemates
since we were done boarding
but then roommate came along
and it was funny

how i was in love with her
but she turn out to only
only want to talk to you
gave you a nickname
because you have a quality
she only calls out to you
and knows you better

like when your birthday was
my first instinct was to ask her
because she knows a lot about you
and you know a lot about her
and all i know is you seem to never run out
of things to talk about with each other
it keeps on happening
until she stops crushing my mind

but still, that saturday night
on the way back, when you both talk on the bike
every word of hers i overheard
cuts me right in my arms
and how both my sister and she thought
that i was sleepy
is it because i’m silent?
i was wide awake
i was the fifth wheel that saturday night
she was with her Poppy, and sister was with Godzilla
i simply had no one to talk to
