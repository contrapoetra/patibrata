# Big Brother
### by Dimas Atha Putra

up then when we were packing
look, i thought we’d have time
where we’d go on the server
and play Minecraft
never would i have thought

that we were
busy with missions
i felt that i was
straying further
and further from you

you were everyone’s favorite
they even called you “big brother”
including roommate, and she was the one
that i’ve seen you spent time the most with
the person that was crushing my mind,
and one i spent the most time to play games with,
that’s honestly fine with me
if i were to be included
because all i wanted was

company
i had you, to play games with
then you had her,
and left me behind

i tried to get you back
like how i kept wanting to sit on your bike
but you kept wanting to be with somebody else
or to be alone

but i still felt like we were still besties
so i tried to give you
the first slice
of my birthday cake
and your reaction confirmed
that we weren’t
