# Godzilla
### by Dimas Atha Putra

grey hair
hard red shirt
a familiar hairdo
zooming in and out of focus and
you were the arborists’ beloved

perhaps i see why
like how you make sure
to include someone in a convo
to laugh at their dumb jokes
and think about why it could be funny

nowadays
whenever i make a joke	
i instinctively take a glance
at you because you
kept giggling or laughing
at my dumb jokes
and i thank you for that
