# Sister, Darling
### by Dimas Atha Putra

never held a hand this soft
and never heard a voice this soothing
zoned out when i first met you
i tell you mine as you tell me yours but
raindrops were pooling on the table
and we try to sit somewhere dry

i always hear it like
you say it out of spite
It’s the way you answer my call:
yes, darling?

i surely know i'm not your love, darling
but you made sure to make everyone feel loved
and that's what i love about you

and the way you loved films, and english
so i made sure to share my poems with you
like the one i wrote for your best friend
i hope you know you were going to have one
this very thing you're reading

and how deep i sank when i heard you almost sank
but you pulled through
safe and sound on deck
while i suffocated in front of you
and like how you made everyone feel afloat
i'm sorry i wasn't there to save you

like how you took care of me
after i lost hours of my memory
fed me with your soft little hands
let me embrace you when i was scared
it's when i realized,
you were the little sister i always wanted

and you made sure
to embrace me when we depart
so i threw my arms around you
and pulled you slightly closer
my beloved sister
my little darling

oh how i miss you
i hear your laughter
right outside my room
calling everyone by their nickname
big brother, little Poppy, Godzilla
but i never heard my name
so i am surely not expected
but oh how i wanted to
open my door and greet you
tell you how much i missed you
then i remember, that all of you
never gave me a nickname
so i am on my bed
writing a few words
that i hope you'll read

but you did call me out the next day 
and told me to take a chip
scoop a little of ice cream with it
and enjoy
and my smile grew
as i looked into your cheerful doe-eyes
and you laugh like someone
who just changed somebody's entire life

i am thankful for your life-altering trick
i am thankful for you sharing it with me
I am thankful for you making it out
and noticing the petrichor that saturday night
and telling me that there were perfumes designed to smell like petrichor…
and asking if i were sleepy
and waving at me on the way back

i am thankful for you
never held a hand this soft
and never heard a voice this soothing
zoned out when i first met you
i tell you mine as you tell me yours but
