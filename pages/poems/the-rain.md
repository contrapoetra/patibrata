# The Rain
### by Dimas Atha Putra

pretty soon the rain will stop
exactly after we’re soaking
ready to sit down
exactly to do something

you look at me
how you look at me
since you first met me

and you talk to me
how you to talk to me
since you first met me

ever cheerful

oh how i wish to be like you, my friend
how you comfort
how you excite people
how everyone loves you
how you hide
