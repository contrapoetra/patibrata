# The Boy in White
### by Dimas Atha Putra

mellow as we waited for you
as another just left the group
under the impression
long after we just lost one
in their hearts, they needed you
definitely not gonna lose another
and then you show up

ever graceful
ever fancy
you sat down
and demanded everyone
of the names they just claimed
and your gaze fell
on my white denim
called me out for it
and demanded me
for what to call me
then it was your turn
and you were the birthday girl

but you couldn’t go alongside us
the boat was so empty without you
the arborist who loved you was heartbroken
so we went miles to reunite with you
and the holes were no more
and the arborist was laughing

and you were the only one
who treated me decently
as a stranger
i still don’t know you very well
what i know is that
you made me feel like i belong
you somehow laugh at my jokes
or perhaps at me
though i’m okay with that
you remember that i wanted to get to the book store
and you were too
so when you were going
you made sure to invite me
so i could get this book
to write these poems on

you were kind
to me
the kids
everyone
i quite miss
your laugh and your smile
our banter about languages we master
and the way you make your arborist smile
and how you keep accidentally
calling me, and everyone “darling”
because i know that deep down
you love every arborist like family
<span lang="ar">
من الصعب أن أُصالح قلبي
حين قرّرتِ الزهرةُ المتفتّحةُ الضاحكة
أن ترحلَ عنّا باكرًا
</span>

towards the end of our mission
as the arborists for that community
the kids kept asking me
about you… what happened
it kills me every time
they frown at what i know
but what i know
is that you’re in a battle of wits

the thing
that i thought
was growing in mine
was growing in yours
and i sincerely hope
that you kill it
once and for all
