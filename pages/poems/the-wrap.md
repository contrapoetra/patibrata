# The Wrap
### by Dimas Atha Putra

almost a year of us as a crew
you and me and the wolves
and all i know is cats love you
so, you and me both

and that's our only thing

but oh do i want to talk
about something else
how you comforted me when she was upset
the elephant that slept in between my legs
the semester recap i like best
the video you took at the event
my beloved rotting fountain pen
how we're not really friends yet
how we haven't really met
how i wish to talk with you for minutes
while we wrap boxes for the winners
while the other me cry for no reason

how i wish to, with everyone
how did he do it with you?

perhaps one can't just do it today
even if you act like i can stay
it feels like you want me away

and i now understand something
that you and him are another thing
that's how he never lets you blink
that is why talking
is not our thing

                 you were in the back
twenty-six meters each second
each other wolves pass by
and they are sharing life lessons
were we ever gonna talk?

well i want to go abroad
do you?
no?

i wanted to do my masters
do you?
no?

i wanted to talk to you
but do you?
no?

twenty-six, twenty, ten, three
buddy Jo came along
and your big sharp eyes go rosy
white teeth blooming in song

and songs the two of you sing
one after another

sounds so fun
unfortunately
                   i'm now in the back
sobbing my eyes out in the sun

is it just because of all this?
perhaps that tells me just honest
that's how much i wanted to be friends

…but we are
don't you remember?
                you were in the back
jolting out of sleep
so you made me sing

and oh the songs the two of us sing
how my brother and me ring
how you liked my curly hair
even if it is hard to take care
your curly flower in Anatolia
and many bees for the magnolia
the accident a few hours back
and what i thought happened in a flash
the undertow of which we had no clue
and why i almost didn't go through
how we almost never called it
if you got into what you wanted
disappointments i had for myself
times i broke down right and left
and how you comforted me again
of the same disappointments i face
how buddy Jo said the same thing
exactly what you say about everything
and the obsession i started anew
the poems, like this one i wrote for you

and we never sang again
oh how i missed us
everyday i see you sing with somebody else
and they always loved singing with you 
and i don't blame them

who doesn't love listening to
your soothing voice tell all about yourself
and all the endearing things about you
