# Buddy
### by Dimas Atha Putra

just grateful
over the fact that we ever climbed the mountains together
vast savannah in front of us
and my camera clicks reverberate
negatives imprinted with your charismatic figure

then it was time to go back down
and let the dense mist simmer
over the camps on the savannah
the camera was heavy in my hands
so you took it from me, and pointed it at me

and oh the way i look that day
i've never seen myself look the way i did
warm and cozy in the mist
between the tall grass and trees
tracking stick knocking the ground as i walk

but as arborists
i see a stranger
still kind and charismatic
but funny and collected
so this is the real you, buddy Jo?

the children of the village run would toward our base
every day and night, as we soundly slept inside
buddy Jo? buddy Jo!
they screamed, waking up every arborists
they just can’t get enough with you

and you, of course, walk outside
greet them with a smile
ask about how school was
and they would show you their drawings 
then you walk toward one of them

then you high-five each other
slapping each other’s backhand
and then a fist bump
like the two of you
have been doing it since forever

how come i’ve never seen this side

during our time as arborists
my eyes sobbed in four different times
behind three of them
was this affable quality of yours
and disappointments in mine

the first time
during our time teaching the children to read
i tried to get my roommate to talk
she responded in a few simplest of words
like someone dying of boredom
and turned her head away from me
then you came in
and with a new shine in her eyes
she read you a novel

the second time
my sister’s best friend and you
were wrapping boxes of gifts
for whoever would be good enough
you made her smile
you made her laugh
you made her talk for hours
and i hugged my pillow
disappointed in myself because i could never
never could made her feel special like that

the third time
i tried to talk with her
but we were going twenty-six meters per second
the wind was breezing too fast
she could’ve never heard me
and so, we never talked that whole ride
i felt really bad, boring her in the back of her own Blackie
so when we stopped, you took my place
i thank you in my heart
for saving both her and me
from that awful awkward tension
then i sat in the back of big brother’s bike
i glanced at you and her having the time of your lives
i hated myself
for not being able to entertain her the way you do

the fourth
my roommate spoke her truth
that if someone never became an arborist with her
she would rather it be me
i tried not to take it personally, like she asked me to
but we had so many moments i cherish
i went down the memory lane
revisiting those moments
and broke down crying
i simply couldn’t imagine
not ever going on this adventure
especially with her
and after you found me alone on the balcony
you took my hands and led me downstairs
and we sat on the chair on the terrace
and you comforted me
that night i understood
why everyone loves talking with you
way more than they do with me
as much as you talk
you made everyone feel heard

didn’t know there’s so much
to the art of conversation
