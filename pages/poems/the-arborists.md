# The Arborists
### by Dimas Atha Putra

day one
a meet of the arborists
novel eyes of us at each other, claiming our names
your head nods up and down when you hear mine
a kind of name you always hear

but we emerge from the same room
yet i've never seen your face
it kind of baffled me, we were roommates
thought we could've known each other

thought we could've gone back there together

day two
it's fascinating
how the line of history was just
just pieces of paper with 
a string of numbers and a name
but every time i see you 
each of those numbers gets a color

they are cold
they are bright
they are vibrant
they are just like your blue dress
they are just like what you make me feel

day three
i wasn't sleepy
but i was crying
i couldn't reconcile
why we couldn't sing
even though you can
because i tried to get you to sing
but you look like you're sleepy
then buddy Jo came along
and in an instant you spill out
your entire heart out
told him your childhood
told him your life's story
while your back was staring
at me crying my eyes out just the way i do

but then i stop
a few of those baby oranges
they were crying at me
i made sure to keep some for you
because you told me you wanted them
and in a pure dopamine rush
you gasp at the sight of them and utter to me, “love you”
like someone drunk on something
but i can only nod and smile because oh well
as much as i wished the way you meant it
you do say that to every other arborists

day four
and our missions are done
but then you had to aim the gun
at one of us, and pull the trigger

i know you had to choose one
but why should it be me?

you told me that it wasn't personal
and not to think about it too much
but honestly I can't
i can't not think about that time, 
when i was struggling
to get the other end of my backpack
and you pulled it out for me
that time when
i saw you were craving for those baby oranges
and i saved some for you
and how bright your eyes were shining
looking at them, excited for them
that time when i rushed to your side 
when you were alone in the blue seashore
and i invited you to collect sea corals 
and one of them you gave to me
i still have some of them in my jacket
it's my letter to current me
reminding me of the fun we had at the seashore
we had so much
but even with all that
i am still the furthest to you
compared to buddy Jo, big brother, and little Poppy.
so if one had never went with you on this journey
if the boat was overcrowded
and someone had to be thrown overboard
you chose for it to be me
and my eyes look down the barrel
of your revolver, and you pulled the trigger

and you shot me between the eyes
and i sobbed the rest of the night

what i can take is that
i failed to get your attention
thus i’ll never get to be your friend
the way a big brother and a poppy are
one on which you can lean on
for any of your difficulties
one who will always be there for you
for any of your hardships
that you need to tell somebody
let alone someone
you can lean on when you're sad
or who i can lean on when i am

i can do all that
but i won’t be your first choice
even when we say our goodbyes
as i say good luck to you
you needed big brother
to hear what i said

though i always listen
when you talk about your crush 
the person you're infatuated with
the way he is infatuated with you
yet the both of you
don't know what to call the both of you yet
i listen in awe
because you were mine…
oh to be the one
you talk about the way you did

the way you talk to everybody
as if you are all best friends
you act like this with everyone
but exactly one person 
me
the only one you don't invite to talk
the only one you don't invite to spend time with you
the only one you don't invite
the only one you don't greet
the way you greet big brother and dear Poppy
the only one you don't ever feed with your soft lovely hand
like you did one time
when i was in bed
in a hospital
the only time i ever felt loved by you
and how i felt sorry for every other me
for they will never going to feel
being cared for by you

i cleaned out a chair next to me
as i see you sit down cross legged
on the cold floor when it was raining outside
and i thought you were cold, and tired
after you break your little fast before the holy month came
but you never sat down
and you yelled out to your Poppy
if you can lay down in his room
and off you went
each step you went further and further from me
my ribcage felt like the floor you stomp on the way there

when we went to go camping
you notice big brother feeling down
and like the big sister you are
you comfort him
it reminds me
that you've done this many times
to everyone but me
where i stay in the basement
still down there, with nobody to help
like after you shot me
and i was sobbing my eyes out
i tried so hard to lower the volume
but the sounds were still clear
and i do notice how
you kept on going
like nothing happened
and when you invited everyone in the camp
everyone but me
and even after i asked to join
after i've been drenched in the rain
none of you said anything
it's as if
you don't want to include me
so i went as far away as you need me
and when i get back
dead silence
not even then
no one wants to talk to me
but i overheard
that when i was gone
fireflies met you
and gave you company
while mosquitoes
drained my feet in the dark 
my poor heart
i love them
fireflies should accompany me
instead of blood-sucking nobodies
and in breakfast i sat
between you and your Poppy
with no energy to take a bite i watched
as you take a spoonful
and put it in front of your Poppy
and i watched that twice
three times
four times
and i lost count
as i take a spoonful myself
and tried to enjoy our noodles

and on the way home i was in awe
watching you pull him close
rest your face on his back
and drift off into sleep
then you and Poppy were preparing
you asked for my help
but i said something stupid
because i thought we were taught
not to share nail clippers
and so i broke your heart
and you think i hated you
but nothing could be further from the truth
i loved you
from the top of my heart
but know that
it's not because you were very kind to me
not because you did anything
i fell for you just for being you
and what did i do?
i broke your heart
and i will never be able
never be able to forgive myself

as my weak left hand types this out
i mourn you
a friend that could’ve been
how we could've loved each other 
and perhaps i can try
to find one just like you
and love you through them
but i have a feeling
that they won't be the one
that they will never be able
never be able to be a proxy to you
that i only wanted
you

but please stay
stay being affectionate to your Poppy, big brother,
and everyone else you're affectionate with
even if that person isn't me
please keep being you 
because i know
this is essentially how you are
the one i know and love with all my heart
